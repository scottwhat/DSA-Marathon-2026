# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
# https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

def pacificAtlantic(heights):
    """
    There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean.
    The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's
    right and bottom edges. Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that
    rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

# DSA Approach (Concise Prep Checklist)
# 1. Repeat the question
# - Restate problem in one sentence (inputs -> transformation -> output)
# - Confirm input types, indexing (0 vs 1), single vs multiple test cases
# - Ask edge cases: empty, single element, duplicates, negatives, overflow
# - Confirm allowed operations: modify input, sort, extra memory, recursion limits
# - Clarify constraints: max/min n, value ranges, time/memory limits, target Big-O
# - Confirm output format, ordering, stability, tie-breakers, no-solution behavior
# - Ask for 1 normal + 1 tricky example with expected output
# - Confirm environment expectations: libraries, full I/O vs function only, tests required

# 2. Clarifying questions
# - Inputs: type, size, range, sorted?, mutable?
# - Outputs: format, order, duplicates allowed?
# - Constraints: n, value bounds, performance target
# - Sorting: allowed? stability required?
# - Memory: fits in memory or streaming?
# - Special cases: empty, all same, extreme values, cycles (if applicable)

# 3. Work through an example
# - Use small sample input
# - Step through logic manually
# - Track pointers/stack/queue/map state
# - Verify expected output and edge behavior

# 4. Brainstorm solutions
# - Identify pattern: hash, two pointers, sliding window, stack, heap, BFS/DFS, DP, greedy
# - Start with brute force and its Big-O
# - Propose optimal approach and tradeoffs
# - Match data structure to need (lookup, ordering, top-k, dependencies)

# 5. Step out the solution
# - Choose approach + data structures
# - Write steps in plain logic/pseudocode
# - Define loop invariants
# - Dry-run on example
# - State time and space complexity

# 6. Convert to code
# - Translate steps directly to code
# - Comment intent and invariants
# - Handle edge cases early
# - Re-run example and edge cases mentally
# 7. Verify and explain
# - Restate final Big-O
# - Explain correctness briefly
# - Mention alternative approaches if asked
