# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

def orangesRotting(grid):
    """
    You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
    0 representing an empty cell, 1 representing a fresh orange, or 2 representing a rotten orange.
    Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
    Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.
    If this is impossible, return -1.

        grid: List[List[int]]
        
    Returns:
        int - minimum minutes
